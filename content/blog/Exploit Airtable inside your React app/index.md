## Intro
At [Karbon üå±](https://www.karbon.earth/), we iterate fast and we are always looking for ways to improve our products and services. 

We had the idea of building an idea box, allowing users to create, share and vote for ideas of new features.

This is the typical project where we have to store unsensitive data entered by users. However we wanted to avoid impacting the rest of our application (e.g we don't want to change our database schema).

[Airtable](https://airtable.com/) is a great tool for this kind of usecase.

## Let's build this idea box ! üó≥Ô∏è
Airtable provides an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/airtable) to interact with their API.
However, since I was working with multiple tables (one for votes, another one for ideas), I found myself repeating a lot of boilerplate code.
I landed on a [hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-airtable) that seemed to provide a nice abstraction to interact with Airtable, but it had some bugs and the author didn't seem to willing to spend time on it. So I decided to write my own hook.

On top of fixing a few issues, I worked on the following points : 
- provide an option to handle errors when fetching, updating or deleting data
- provide an option to filter records using Airtable's `QueryParams`

## Usage üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

Install the hook and Airtable's package with your favorite package manager, for example npm :
```bash
npm install --save airtable use-airtable-crud
```

```typescript
const { records, createRecord, updateRecord, deleteRecord, getRecords, loading } = useAirtable(
    'TABLE_NAME',
    AIRTABLE_API_KEY,
    'TABLE_BASE_ID',
    {
      filterByFormula: '{myField} = TRUE()',
    },
  );
```

You can find the source code of the hook [here](https://github.com/NansD/use-airtable-crud).

## Outro
I hope this hook can be useful for you too! Prototyping and iterating is a great way to learn new things.
